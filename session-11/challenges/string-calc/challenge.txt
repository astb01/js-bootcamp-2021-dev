Kata: String Calculator (TDD) 
Casio would like to introduce a Calculator program that takes a string and can perform the add operation on all numbers provided. 
Requirements are:

1. An empty string should return zero. 
2. A single number returns the value. 
3. Two numbers comma delimited returns the sum (2, 2 = 4). 
4. Support multiple delimiters to separate the numbers between the numbers. Again the sum should still be returned. ~ | or ,
Handle more than 2 numbers. 
5. Passing negative numbers will be handled by producing an error.
6. Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored. So if passing 1001 + 2 then this should result in 2.
